Full Stack  SNHU Course 

In this full stack application a MEAN architecture was used.
For the front-end,Express HTML, Angular, Node/Java
Script were used. For the backend, NoSQL MongoDB was used because this is a simple app that does not do a lot of queries. Thus, the framework and speed of queries weighed out the negatives.

JSON is used to transfer the data from the DB to the client. It is based off of JavaScript syntax but it works with other programming languages too.
The code has been refactored in order to maintain clean and easily understandable code. There are partials used for the navbar, header and footer inorder to save space in each file.The data was seeded with mongoose in order to test the functionality of the website.

This course has helped me organize my code better. Separating the MVC files took a bit to get used to. Having the models, views, and controllers, separated makes the code easier to work with in the long run.
